As we begin to work on more project work, we are being asked to provide more background
on previous projects that we have completed.  At a moments notice, we have to be ready
to provide information on all the projects (that we've worked on) related to various
technologies... all in the hope of landing even more work.<p>

Towards this end, the new project tracking section of the intranet will
track current (and past) projects and enable us to relate them to Sarks and
technologies.  With this system in place, we hope to better leverage our existing project
work to gain even more work in the future...<p> 

To skim through summaries of projects out at the various projects, select
"<a href="clients.asp">Client Summaries</a>" from the Project navigation.
Or feel free to browse the individual clients and detailed information.<p>
