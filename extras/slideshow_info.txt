SLIDESHOW INFO

To put together a slide show...

 - go into a PowerPoint presentation and save it as *.JPG, and save the entire presentation.
 - Since it saves the images as extremely LARGE (959 x ?) images, go into a graphics program
   and drop it down to 475 x 356.  You will also want to sharpen it.  Then save it.
 - MAKE SURE THAT THE SLIDES ARE NAMED:  slide1.???, slide2.???, etc. !!!
 - Create a directory under "extras" for the slideshow... be sure to use a date!
 - Upload the images to the directory, and add a link to the slide show...



 <a href='javascript:SlideShow("Solution Services 3-18", "SolutionServices_19990318")'>View slides</a>)


 - NOTE:  The javascript function for displaying the slideshow is contained in the
          header.asp file... so it is included on every page on the Intranet site!
