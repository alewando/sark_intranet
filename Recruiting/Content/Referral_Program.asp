<font size=2.5 color=maroon><center><b>EMPLOYEE REFERRAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM</b></center></font><p><font color=black>
Due to the ongoing excellence of Software Architects' Consultants and the continuing success of our marketing efforts,the demand for additional consultants by our clients is constantly increasing.  In order to better meet this demand,and continue our current growth rate, we continually seek experienced, qualified computer professionals who meet thehigh standards and values held by the existing staff members.<p>The most efficient and cost effective method of hiring high quality consultants is through the employee referral process.  Incentive awards are given to Sarks for the referral of highly qualified applicants.  If a referred individual is hired, the Sark making the referral will earn a <font color=red><b>$1000</b></font> referral bonus.  This bonus is included as part of your regular paycheckin the pay period following the one in which the individual starts.  </font>
<p><font size=1.5 color=maroon><b>QUALIFIED REFERRALS</b></font><br>
<font color=black>
1.  The name of the referral and preferrably a resume must be given to the recruiter.  A candidate will not be a
    qualified referral if the candidate's name is not given before contact with the recruiter.<p>
2.  The referral may be an experienced individual or a college student.  In order for a college candidate to be a 	qualified referral, the student cannot have submitted their resume to Software Architects, and the referral must	be the first time the recruiter has heard of the individual.  Please contact Tim or John to discuss this situation.<p>
3.  The individual who has been referred must be receptive to Software Architects and have an interest in being contacted
	by Software Architects.
