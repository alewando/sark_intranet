<p class=MsoNormal>Greetings to all Sarks wherever you may be. As you all know
the past few months have been very active at Software Architects. The most
visible events have been the Software Architects/Fremont Partners alliance and
the subsequent rolling out of the Employee Stock Option Plan. What you may not
know is how much has been happening on other fronts. Hopefully this newsflash
will get you up to date.</p>

Kathan,<span style='font-weight:normal'> who had been the Sr. Manager of
Solution Services in Columbus, has been appointed Branch Manager in
Indianapolis. Dave has been with the company for 15 years and has worked in a
number of positions in the Dallas and Columbus offices. </span>John Byrne<span
style='font-weight:normal'> has been named Sales Manager in Indianapolis. John
is relocating from our Chicago office where he was a Senior Sales
Representative. John joined Software Architects in 1998 and has played a key
role in Chicago sales since joining the firm. Congratulations to both Dave and
John in their new positions.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the consulting front, the nucleus of our consulting team
will consist of 3 consultants who have relocated from other Sark branches. From
Chicago we have <b>Brian Bailey</b> and from Columbus we have <b>Todd Elfreich</b>
and <b>Alex Summerall</b>. Congratulations to Brian, Todd and Alex. Thanks for
your past efforts and your willingness to relocate to a new office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Indianapolis office will be part of the Central Region

<h1>San Diego</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also on July 1<sup>st</sup> we opened a new branch office in
San Diego, California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><b>Bill Tanca</b>
who most recently has been our National Recruiting Manager has accepted the
position of Branch Manager in San Diego. Bill has been with Software Architects
for over 10 years in various recruiting roles. Bill’s original role was to
build and grow the Dallas recruiting function. In 1997 Bill became our National
Recruiting Manager. In this position he worked to establish a company wide
consistency in our recruiting process. Bill also has been critical to helping
get new offices up and running with initial recruiting efforts. Bill has
brought many excellent Sarks into the firm. As much as we want to congratulate
Bill he needs to share the spotlight with his better half: Pam. There is
perhaps no better example of what it means to be a Sark than <b>Pam Tanca</b>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pam has been with Software Architects for 15
years, joining the firm right after graduating from Illinois State. She has
worked in both the Chicago and Dallas branch offices and is currently a Practice
Area Lead in the Dallas Solution Services Group. Pam’s dedication and loyalty
to the firm have been outstanding and for that we thank her. Pam will play a
key role as we build the Solution Services function in the new San Diego
office. Congratulations and thanks to both Pam and Bill as they begin their
excellent adventure in San Diego.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the sales side of the house, <b>Denise McCammon</b> has
relocated from Dallas to become our first Sales Representative in San Diego.
Although Denise has only been with Software Architects for about 2 years, she
has demonstrated an ability to open new business in Dallas and we are confident
that she will do the same in San Diego. Good luck, Denise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to Pam Tanca we also have <b>Diane Nagel</b> as
part as the initial core our consulting team. Diane is relocating from Dallas
and has been with the company for 6 years. Thanks Diane for your efforts on
behalf of Sark and good luck in San Diego. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The San Diego branch will be part of the Southwest Region
and will report to Mike Collins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The San Diego office is located at 701 Palomar Airport Road,

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Effective July 1<sup>st</sup> the following individuals have
been promoted:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mitch Rhinehart</b> to <b>Director</b> - Southeast

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Michelle Costello</b> to <b>Vice President</b> – Midwest
Region; from Director – Midwest Region. (More on Miki later)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mitch, Mike, Ed and Miki have each been a cornerstone of
Software Architects growth for over 15 years. Their loyalty, work ethic and
integrity have always been above reproach. Quite simply, we would not be where
we are today without the combined efforts of these individuals. By my count
they have over 50 years of combined experience with Sark and have worked in a
total of 13 different branch offices. Now that’s COMMITMENT. Congratulations to
each of you on your promotions and continued good luck in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also effective July 1<sup>st, </sup>the following Sales
Managers have been promoted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>D.J. Wardynski </b>to <b>Sales Manager</b> – Denver; from
Sr. Sales Representative – Denver<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Terri Burmeister</b> to <b>Sr. Sales Manager</b> – Tampa;

Minneapolis; from Sr. Sales Manager – Minneapolis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Congratulations to D.J., Terri, Tom, Mary, Joelle and Karen.
It almost goes without saying that each of them is a virtual sales “robo-cop”.
Perhaps more impressive I think, is the manner in which they represent Software
Architects out in the client community. Their commitment to our business model
and to the standards we have set over the years is to be commended. I think all
of us can rest assured that sales will continue to grow in their hands.</p>

<h3>Marketing and Branding</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>One of the most
frequently asked questions during the Stock Option Presentations was where the
company stood on improving our brand awareness and marketing plans. Or more
directly, “What are you guys doing with all that Fremont money?” Well here
goes: For those of you who have not yet seen it, I’m very excited to announce
the unveiling of our new web site. (<a href="http://www.sark.com/">http://www.sark.com/</a>).
While there are a number of updates and improvements still to be made, it is
clearly a big step in the entire process of improving our name recognition.
Beyond that, I’m happy to report that we are well on our way to finishing the
next phase of this process. Without going into too much detail this means that
we have outsourced our Corporate Branding and Name Recognition requirements to
BSMG Worldwide Visual Communications. This is a 4 to 6 week process whereby we
will review our image, past history and future direction, as well as gathering some
customer perceptions about us. They will analyze all of our graphic materials
and we will receive recommendations for any potential changes. Also included
will be recommendations for “positioning statements” on Software Architects. We
will also receive a stationary package, which will have recommended layouts for
new stationary, business cards etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
last deliverable will be a Graphics Standards Manual. This manual would then
help us as we go forward into the next phase, which would include developing
all of our new collateral material. This would include things like new
sales/marketing and recruiting pieces. This is an exciting new process for the
company and will ultimately result in our name and our capabilities becoming
better recognized across the country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Now the sad part!<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is with sadness and mixed feelings that I have to tell
everyone that Miki Costello is “retiring” from Software Architects at the end
of the year. That’s right, Miki has decided that she wants to stay at home and
spend more time with her children. Miki has been with Software Architects since
1984. She joined the firm right out of Illinois State as a consultant in the
Chicago branch and has moved up through the ranks to her current position as
Vice President of the Midwest Region. Miki has lived in Chicago, Dallas,
Columbus, Tampa and Chicago (2<sup>nd</sup> tour of duty) during her career
here. Miki is perhaps one the hardest working, most honest people I have ever
met and I consider it privilege to have worked with her for all these years.
While it is sad to think of Miki not being at Software Architects in the
future, it is also a time of happiness for her to be able to look forward to
another chapter in her life. I’m sure we will have a grand send off for Miki as
the date draws near but for now …<b>GOOD LUCK MIKI!<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miki will continue to be responsible for the Midwest Region
until her departure at the end of December. We are currently in the process of
planning how to go about finding a replacement for Miki and we will have more
news on this topic in the next couple of months. In the meantime, your
continued support of Miki and the Midwest Region is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Wrap –up</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All in all, this has been a fantastic few months for the
company. We have completed the Fremont transaction, rolled out a new Employee
Stock Option Plan, opened 2 new branch offices, unveiled a new web site, and
made substantial progress on the marketing/brand awareness front. Also we have
been able to fill a number of key positions by promoting from within the firm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not bad at all!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On behalf of Gene Petrie and Ed Wroble and our new friends
at Fremont Partners, thanks to everyone for helping make Sark what we are today
and what we will be in the future. </p>
