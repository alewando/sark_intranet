            <P><!--BeginText--><B>Summary: The community quest to identify Rule 
            Breaker candidates from the B2B front continues. Tonight we offer a 
            short, simple B2B primer for the uninitiated. As a follow-up, we 
            recommend that you download the suddenly FREE March installment of 
            The Motley Fool Internet Report, which features a more in-depth look 
            at -- you guessed it -- B2B!</B> <BR><BR><BR>Good evening, Fools. 
            Every column presents topic-choice angst, and this one is no 
            exception. Following my <A 
            href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=41190">first</A> two B2B Breaker 
            articles, I've received two kinds of feedback. First, many Fools 
            participating in B2B-related pursuits have been very generous in 
            providing insights and links to excellent resources. The second 
            class of feedback has been of the "get to the point" variety. Not 
            everyone appreciated the Fool stump speech that soaked up most of 
            the <A href="http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=41191">last 
            column</A>.<BR><BR>Like every good business-guy, I like to please my 
            customers. So I'd <I>really </I>like to write a column tonight that 
            starts with lots of high-tech insight and ends with a short list of 
            Rule Breaker B2B candidates. But I'm not ready.<BR><BR>And I'm 
            guessing that the majority of my audience isn't ready either. My 
            first attempt to break down the hopelessly broad B2B arena into some 
            manageable sub-industries led me to employ a lot of industry 
            techno-babble in my column, most of which I didn't really understand 
            well enough to use. I've learned my lesson: when leading a group 
            learning exercise, the worst thing to do is to worry about ego. It 
            doesn't help anyone.<BR><BR>So, as the next step in the quest, I'm 
            going to take a giant step backwards tonight. I want to pass along 
            everything I've learned over the last few weeks, in plain English. I 
            want to do this for two reasons. First, it'll be easier now, before 
            I become so hopelessly immersed in the world of B2B-speak that I can 
            no longer remember what it all means in plain English. And second, I 
            think it will set the stage for a far more useful industry breakdown 
            than my first effort.<BR><BR>In this spirit, then, I 
            present...<BR><BR><B>The world's most condensed, plain-language B2B 
            Primer:</B><BR><BR>Companies buy lots of stuff. Of course in 
            business, big words make for big image, and "buy" is just way too 
            pedestrian to qualify. People "buy" stuff. Businesses <B>procure 
            </B>goods and services.<BR><BR>There are two types of procurement -- 
            direct and indirect. <B>Direct</B> refers to raw materials that go 
            into a company's final products. The simplest examples are from 
            manufacturing. Direct procurement for a candy bar maker, for 
            example, might include chocolate, sugar, peanuts, printed wrappers, 
            and those little cardboard thingies that the bar rests 
            in.<BR><BR><B>Indirect</B> refers to the stuff ordered, for the most 
            part, by the swank folks in the front office -- like travel 
            services, computers, and other office supplies. If this stuff shows 
            up in the final product, we get on the red phone with the lawyers 
            and the PR people.<BR><BR>Businesses have always procured their 
            direct and indirect goods in marketplaces. Nothing new here. In 
            fact, for many years, businesses have been using computers to 
            automate all the drudgery associated with these business-to-business 
            transactions. The premier old technology for business marketplace 
            connections is called Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).<BR><BR>In 
            fact, even within a company (oops, company = <B>enterprise</B> in 
            B2B-speak) there is nothing at all new about automated enterprise 
            processes. For example, no less than the <A 
            href="http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=41192">two largest</A> 
            application software companies in the world, <B>Oracle</B> (Nasdaq: 
            ORCL) and <B>SAP AG</B> (NYSE: SAP), are the leading solutions 
            providers in the enterprise back-office automation game. (Here come 
            the acronyms!). Two big sub-sections of the back-office are 
            <B>ERP</B> (Enterprise Resource Planning) and <B>SCM</B> (Supply 
            Chain Management). On the front-end of the enterprise, the side that 
            interacts directly with customers, we encounter just one dominant 
            acronym -- <B>CRM</B> (Customer Resource Management). <B>Siebel 
            Systems</B> (Nadaq: SEBL) is the emerging CRM 
            gorilla.<BR><BR>Finally, the idea of getting all these acronyms -- 
            EDI, ERP, SCM, CRM -- to communicate with one another isn't even 
            new. The <B>integrators</B>,<B> </B>in the form of software 
            solutions companies and the IT consultants that peddle them, have 
            been around since the dawn of the business computing age.<BR><BR>So 
            what's new? Why all the fuss about B2B?<BR><BR>As usual, it's that 
            Al Gore creation, the <B>Internet</B>. In short, the Internet 
            represents a mega-integrator. Instead of closed, one-to-one EDI 
            markets, the Internet provides the infrastructure for 
            many-buyers-to-many-sellers marketplaces. It allows for totally 
            open, global markets that essentially any enterprise can join, 
            regardless of its geographical location or historical 
            affiliations.<BR><BR>There are two ways to classify this new breed 
            of Internet marketplaces. First, <B>private</B> marketplaces are 
            usually controlled by one (or a few) dominant buyers (typically 
            manufacturing companies) that aren't interested in buying critical 
            raw materials from the lowest bidder. They spend inordinate amounts 
            of time and money qualifying one or two vendors with a fine-tooth 
            comb, right down to individual supplier production lines. Their 
            customers and manufacturing processes can't tolerate the raw 
            material variability that comes with a wide open marketplace. Such 
            private marketplaces are really just a means for increasing 
            efficiency in existing supply chains. <B>Public</B> marketplaces, on 
            the other hand, are creating open exchanges that, in many cases, 
            didn't exist before. Buyers and sellers worldwide are free to join 
            in.<BR><BR>If we don our over-generalization goggles for the next 
            few paragraphs, we can draw parallels between the second way to 
            classify marketplaces and the first, as well as bring in the earlier 
            direct/indirect procurement distinction. Goggles on...<BR><BR>Most 
            private marketplaces are for direct procurement (remember, think 
            "raw materials"). These markets lie wholly within a particular 
            industry. If they spread out, it's usually up and down the supply 
            chain. In other words, the company that supplies chocolate, in our 
            candy bar example, buys from a company that grinds and roasts cacao 
            seeds who, in turn, buys the seeds from another supplier. You get 
            the idea. This type of within-industry market broadening is termed 
            <B>vertical. </B>So, from this overly general viewpoint, we can lump 
            <I>direct</I>, <I>private,</I> and <I>vertical</I> 
            together.<BR><BR>On the other hand, it's tempting to lump 
            <I>indirect</I> and <I>public</I> with <B>horizontal</B>. Markets 
            broaden horizontally when they stay at one "level" (focus on a 
            certain type of good or service), but take in buyers and sellers 
            across many industries. Travel services is the easy example. Almost 
            every company in every industry (horizontal) procures plane tickets, 
            hotel reservations, and rental cars, but not many feed their travel 
            itineraries into their production processes (indirect) and most are 
            more than willing to open the marketplace to as many agents as it 
            takes to get a good deal (public).<BR><BR>Now, goggles off. There 
            are, of course, lots of exceptions to this general clustering. 
            Otherwise, we'd only need one level of distinctions, instead of 
            three. For example, the <A 
            href="http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=41193">Big Three auto parts 
            exchange</A> is a great example of a <I>vertical</I> market for 
            <I>direct</I> goods, but it will be public -- open to any supplier 
            that qualifies and subscribes. This is just the tip of the exception 
            iceberg, but I still think it's useful, as a mental starting point, 
            to cluster these markets into the two clustered 
            stereotypes.<BR><BR>Finally, every market has buyers and sellers. In 
            B2B jargon, we think in terms of <B>buy-side</B> and 
            <B>sell-side</B>. Let's start by looking at this distinction from 
            the standpoint of a major manufacturer of consumer products. You 
            plug yourself into a raw material exchange as a buyer. Sell-side 
            goes with your consumer interface. You want to create a slick Web 
            interface that draws in individual consumers and personalizes their 
            experience and, potentially, their order.<BR><BR>This 
            buy-side/sell-side thing can get confusing, however. For example, if 
            you are a supplier of raw materials to a major manufacturer, and you 
            want to participate in an Internet marketplace, your fundamental 
            challenge is moving your product catalog to the Net. This is your 
            sell-side. But it is very different from building a slick consumer 
            interface and demands a different set of Web tools. <BR><BR>When 
            thinking about buy-side and sell-side, then, it helps to have 
            context. Identify which company or type of company you are talking 
            about and identify its customers. This will lead you to the 
            front-office, the sell-side. Likewise for the back-office and 
            buy-side.<BR><BR><B>Next Steps:</B><BR>With this simple primer as a 
            starting point, I recommend the following <B>FREE</B> Motley Fool 
            resource. It fleshes out this spare skeleton. With the simple 
            background in this column. I hope it will make sense to anybody, 
            regardless of B2B sophistication: <BR><BR>
